# Time-of-Day-mod-for-DDLC-Mood-Posing-Tool
This is my version of MPT that adds the ability to have MatrixColor effects, aka time of day

# Prerequisites:
 
To respect the wishes of the MPT Developers I can not include their art assets in this build. So you will need to go download a version of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCMods/comments/emennq/mood_posing_tool_mpt_v10_release_for_ddlc_modding/)

Get the 'unpacked" zip, or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/136KBThnImX3qABRlMO8YKykM5gtLI_6x) is a link to there current version



# How to install:

Again sorry to make this complicated but again I canâ€™t include a full just download me and be done zip.

Anyways, you will want to download that zip of MPT. Open it and copy the game/mod_assets from the zip folder into you game folder. Now simply copy the contents of this mod into the mod_assets folder and you are done. 

You could copy it all but that is only if you want to use the MPT mode. Doing it this way will simply allow you to use the time of day function and Layered Image stuff in any build


# Please Credit:
If you decide to share this please credit myself as well as the original artists be they drawn as well as code.
